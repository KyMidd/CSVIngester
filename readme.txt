#README

Ingests several CSV files (not shown, as they contain personal data), processes them into easily readable, sorted, data, and will (eventually) combine all that data based on the key value (first column in each processed CSV) into a centralized datasheet. 

TODO: 
Figure out final combination based on data-set KEY (first column values (site codes) in each processed CSV)
